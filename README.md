# Learning Path - Data Structure and Algorithms

## Data Structure
The term **"data structure"** refers to a system of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and used efficiently by a computer. There are various types of data structures, and some are highly specialized to perform specific functions. In addition to enabling the storage of data, data structures also provide efficient algorithms for performing various operations on the data (**insertion, deletion, traversal, search, etc.**).

### Types of data structures

1. **Primitive Data Structures:** These are the basic data structures that operate directly on the machine instructions.
    * **Integer**: Represents numerical values. 
    * **Float**: Represents floating-point values. 
    * **Character**: Represents single characters (e.g., ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘1’). 
    * **Boolean**: Represents truth values (True/False).


2. **Non-Primitive Data Structures:** These data structures are more complex than primitive data types and are derived from them.
   * **Arrays:** An array consists of a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are usually fixed in size and can be accessed by index in most programming languages. 
   * **Linked Lists:** A linked list is a linear collection of data elements in which each element points to the next. The size of linked lists is dynamic. 
   * **Stacks:** A stack is a linear data structure based on the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. As a rule of thumb, the last element added to the list is the first one to be removed. 
   * **Queues:** A linear data structure based on the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added is the first to be removed. 
   * **Trees:** Hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. The top node is called the root, and each node can have zero or more children. 
   * **Graphs:** A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between nodes). It can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted. 
   * **Hash Tables (Hash Maps):** A data structure that provides efficient lookup by mapping keys to values using a hash function.

### <u>Operations on Data Structures:</u>

* **Insertion:** Adding an element to a data structure. 
* **Deletion:** Removing an element from a data structure. 
* **Traversal:** Accessing and processing each data structure element. 
* **Searching:** Finding a particular element in the data structure. 
* **Sorting:** Arranging elements in a specific order (ascending/descending).

## Algorithms

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules that must be followed by a computer in order to perform calculations or solve problems. An algorithm is a blueprint for performing specific tasks in the most efficient manner.

### Characteristics of Algorithms:

* **Input:** Algorithms require one or more inputs (data to be processed). 
* **Output:** At least one output is produced by an algorithm. 
* **Definiteness:** Each step must be clearly defined. 
* **Finiteness:** Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps. 
* **Effectiveness:** Each step of the algorithm should be simple and feasible.
